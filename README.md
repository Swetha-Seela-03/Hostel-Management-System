# Hostel-Management-System
An Online Hostel Management System is like a digital assistant for managing a
hostel. Imagine it as a smart tool that helps with everything from booking rooms to
keeping track of who's staying where. People can easily register and reserve rooms
online. It's not just about making things digital; it also keeps everything organized.
For example, it helps staff manage their schedules, ensures security by controlling
who has access to what information, and provides reports on how well the hostel is
doing.An Online Hostel Management System (OHMS) offers a range of services to
efficiently manage and streamline hostel operations.
